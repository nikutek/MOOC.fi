University of Helsinki’s massive open online course (MOOC) on programming

The course content is also no longer updated or maintained by it's creators.
Sadly due to a bug in exercise part07-Part07_07.RecipeSearch I am not able to get the points required to be granted a certificate. Localy downloaded test cases' names dont match the names on the server resulting in constant errors in the TMC tool. I strongly belive my code works as intended.

However, even without having the course oficially 100% completed,I belive it helped me learn and become overall a better developer.
